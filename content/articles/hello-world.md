This post is for testing purposes, I'm going to test.

This is a functional [link](#) amid a text.

This is the **bold** text.

This is the *italics*.

# This is a Heading 1

## This is a heading 2

### This is a Heading 3

# Heading 1

This is the start of a paragraph text. I'm going to write something fun here, but I see no way of making an argument, or even to come up with things to say. I'm typing blindly not focusing on what am I saying.

This is a paragraph switch to spice things up, now I'm going to use a **bold text for a while**, then I'll switch it over to the *italics, I will keep on using it until I reach a point where I can't use it no* more. Now, I guess, it's time to insert a [link that's going to escape](#) me out of this website. 

I also want to test some emojis, that's why I'm going to use some emojis for the fun. :smile:
